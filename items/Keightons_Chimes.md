# Keighton's Chimes
Playing these instruments requires a DC 15 Charisma (Performance) check.
When played successfully, the chimes conjure small spectral illusions that 
reenact past events in the area within 30 feet of the performance. The more 
significant the event, the more likely it is to play out.

Further more if you are attuned to this item, it gains the following property:

***Spells.*** You can use an action to play the instrument and cast one og the 
following spells: *blur, moonbeam, fog cloud (3rd level), pass without trace*

Once the instrument has been used to cast a spell, it can't be used to cast a 
spell again until the next dawn. The spells use your Charisma as your 
spellcasting ability and for your spell save DC.
