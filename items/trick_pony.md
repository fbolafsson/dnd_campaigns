#Leikfangahestur JÃ¡ks

This item resembles a plain hobby horse with a mane of yellowed yarn, worn 
velvet button eyes and rein of soft golden chain. If you spend an action 
pantomiming riding a horse, complete with self-made horse noises and a name
for your mighty beast, you cast phantom steed. Once used, this property can't 
be used again until the next dawn. The steed turns back into the hobby horse
when the spell ends.
