# Weapon Special attack

### Attack Save DC 
Some of your attacks require your target to make a saving throw to resist the attacks effects. The saving throw DC is calculated as follows:

Maneuver save DC = 8 + your proficiency bonus + your weapon ability modifier.

### Cleave
Attack targets in range up to your ability modifier. You don't add your 
ability modifier to the damage of the attacks.

### Bash
Double your ability modifier on your attack roll. You don't add your ability 
modifier to the damage of the attack.

### Hobble
Forgo your ability modifier on the damage roll and the target must make a 
dexterity saving throw, on a failed save the targets movement is halved.

### Brace
If you did not move on your last turn, other creatures provoke an opportunity 
attack from you when they enter your reach.

### Slash
Forgo damage to give the target a *bleeding* condition equal to your ability 
modifier. 

*Bleeding condition (n):* At the start of your turn take *(n)* damage. At the
end of your turn you can make a *Constitution saving throw*, on a success 
you lose the bleeding condition.
