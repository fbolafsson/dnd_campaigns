**Overwhelm.** If a visible enemy starts turn within 5 feet of three or more 
ghoul minions, the enemy's speed is reduced by 5 feet for each ghoul minion 
within 5 feet (to a minimum speed of 0 feet) until the start of their next 
turn. If the enemy's walking speed is reduced to 0 they are restraint until the 
start of their next turn.

**Stench.** Any creature that starts its turn within 5 feet of the ghast must 
succeed on a DC 10 Constitution saving throw or be poisoned until the start of 
its next turn. On a successful saving throw, the creature is immune to the 
ghast's Stench for 24 hours.

**Turning Defiance.** The ghast and any ghouls within 30 feet of it have 
advantage on saving throws against effects that turn undead.

**Rise Again.** The first time a ghoul minion is reduced to 0 hit points, they
return to life at the start of their next turn with 13 hit points.
