**Aura of Hate.** While Arkhan isn’t incapacitated, he and all fiends and 
undead within 30 feet of him deal 4 extra damage whenever they hit with a melee
weapon attack (already factored into Arkhan’s attacks). This extra damage is of
the same type as the weapon’s damage type.

**Innate Spellcasting.** Arkhan’s spellcasting ability is Charisma (spell save
DC 17). He can cast the following spells, requiring no material components:

3/day each: fear, branding smite (at 4th level), revivify

1/day each: confusion, raise dead

**Special Equipment.** Arkhan wields Náðæta and wears a suit of Obsidian 
Flint Dragon Half-Plate. The armor gives Arkhan advantage on ability checks and 
saving throws made to avoid or end the grappled condition on him.

Náðæta, +2 spear on a natural 20 the spear does 2d8 necrotic damage in addition
you regain a number of hitpoints equal to the necrotic damage taken

Dreka Hrafntinnu Half-plate, +2 Half plate grants resistance to fire. You
gain advantage checks to avoid grapple on yourself or to end them.

### Actions

---
**Multiattack.** Arkhan makes three weapon attacks.

**Náðæta (spear).** Melee Weapon Attack: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. 
Hit: 14 (1d6 + 11) piercing damage, or 15 (1d8 + 11) slashing damage when used 
with two hands, plus 9 (2d8) cold damage. If the target is a creature and 
Arkhan rolls a 20 on the attack roll, the creature takes an extra 9 (2d8) 
necrotic damage, and Arkhan regains an amount of hit points equal to the 
necrotic damage dealt.

**Javelin.** Melee or Ranged Weapon Attack: +10 to hit, reach 5 ft. or 
range 30/120 ft., one target. Hit: 8 (1d6 + 5) piercing damage, plus 4 piercing
damage and 9 (2d8) cold damage if the javelin was used to make a melee attack.

### Bonus Action

---
When Arkhan attacks with Náðæta he can make a bonus action attack with the 
blunt end of the spear: +12 to hit, reach 5 ft., one target. Hit 13 (1d4 + 11)
bludgeoning damage, plus 9 (2d8) cold damage. If the target is a creature and 
Arkhan rolls a 20 on the attack roll, the creature takes an extra 9 (2d8) 
necrotic damage, and Arkhan regains an amount of hit points equal to the 
necrotic damage dealt.


### Reaction

---
When ever a creature enters Arkhans reach, Arkhan can make an attack of 
opportunity with Náðæta against that target.
