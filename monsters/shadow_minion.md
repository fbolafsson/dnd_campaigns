### ACTIONS

---
**Strength Drain.** Melee Weapon Attack: +5 to hit, reach 5 ft., one creature. 
Hit: 3 necrotic damage, and the target's Strength score is reduced by 
1d4. The target dies if this reduces its Strength to 0. Otherwise, the 
reduction lasts until the target finishes a short or long rest.

If a non-evil humanoid dies from this attack, a new shadow rises from the corpse 1d4 hours later.
